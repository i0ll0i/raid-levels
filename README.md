# RAID Levels
RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks) is a technology used to combine multiple physical disk drives into a single logical unit for the purposes of data redundancy, performance improvement, or both.
There are several types of RAID configurations.
## RAID 0 (Striping)
**Description:** Data is split across multiple disks.

**Advantages:** Improved performance due to parallelism.

**Disadvantages:** No redundancy; if one disk fails, all data is lost.

**Use Case:** High-performance applications where data loss is not critical.
